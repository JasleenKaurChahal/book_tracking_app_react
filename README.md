# Udacity Jasleen Book Tracking App

This application allows you to place selected books into a designated shelf. Users can also search the Udacity database for books to add to their initial book shelfs. There are two pages. The Homepage displays the three bookshelfs, currently reading, want to read, and read. The search page will allow the user to search for books.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following:

* Node.js
* The command line
* NPM

## Installation

Access the projects folder and run `npm install` from the command line to install the dependencies. Once installed run the command `npm start` to load application on local host 3000.

## How to use

### Choosing which shelf to send a book to
Once loaded you may choose which shelf to send a book to by clicking on the green circle with a down arrow of any book.

### Search for a book to add to shelf
To access the search page select the plus icon located at the bottom right of the page. Type in the search field for possible books to be found. No results will be displayed if the input field is blank or the query you've typed does not exist.

The process of adding a book to a shelf is identical to the process described in the previous section. Once the option is selected the book will be displayed on the selected shelf on the main page of the application.

To return to the main page you may use the back arrow in the input area at the top or the browsers back arrow.


## Required Dependencies to run the Book Tracking App Project

## Go into the project directory and run the below command to install the dependencies 

npm install --save react-debounce-input 
npm install --save react-router-dom


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
